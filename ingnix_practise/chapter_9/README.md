This chapter covers streaming media with NGINX in MPEG-4 (MP4) or Flash Video (FLV) formats. NGINX is widely used to distribute and stream content to the masses. NGINX supports industry-standard formats and streaming technologies, which will be covered in this chapter. NGINX Plus enables the ability to fragment content on the fly with the HTTP Live Stream (HLS) module, as well as the ability to deliver HTTP Dynamic Streaming (HDS) of already fragmented media. NGINX natively allows for bandwidth limits, and NGINX Plus’s advanced features offer bitrate limiting, ena‐ bling your content to be delivered in the most efficient manner while reserving the servers’ resources to reach the most users.
