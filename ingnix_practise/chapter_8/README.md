HTTP/2 is a major revision to the HTTP protocol. Much of the work done in this version was focused on the transport layer, such as enabling full request and response multiplexing over a single TCP connection. Efficiencies were gained through the use of compression on HTTP header fields, and support for request prioritization was added. Another large addition to the protocol was the ability for the server to push messages to the client. This chapter details the basic configuration for enabling HTTP/2 in NGINX as well as configuring Googleâ€™s open source remote procedure call (gRPC) and HTTP/2 server push support.
