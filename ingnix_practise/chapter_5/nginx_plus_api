# Problem - You have a dynamic environment and need to reconfigure NGINX Plus on the fly.
# Solution - Configure the NGINX Plus API to enable adding and removing servers through API calls:

upstream backend {
	zone http_backend 64k;
}
server {
	# ...
	location /api {
	api [write=on];
	# Directives limiting access to the API
 	# See chapter 7
	}

	location = /dashboard.html {
	   root	   /usr/share/nginx/html;
	}
}
