# Problem - You need to install and configure NGINX with SaltStack to manage NGINX configurations as code and conform with the rest of your SaltStack configurations.

nginx:
  pkg:
	- installed
  service:
	- name: nginx
	- running
	- enable: True
	- reload: True
	- watch:
	  - file: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:
  file:
	- managed
	- source: salt://path/to/nginx.conf
	- user: root
	- group: root
	- template: jinja
	- mode: 644
	- require:
	  - pkg: nginx
