The advent of cloud providers has changed the landscape of web application hosting. A process such as provisioning a new machine used to take hours to months; now, you can create one with as little as a click or an API call. These cloud providers lease their virtual machines, called infrastructure as a service (IaaS), or managed software solutions such as databases, through a pay-per-usage model, which means you pay only for what you use. This enables engineers to build up entire environments for testing at a moment’s notice and tear them down when they’re no longer needed. These cloud providers also enable applications to scale horizontally based on perfor‐ mance need at a moment’s notice. This chapter covers basic NGINX and NGINX Plus deployments on a couple of the major cloud-provider platforms.
